### Friday Task2 ###
Q1: Clone “FridayTask2” repository from git. The link for cloning is provided as below:  
 https://github.com/AdityaBConsultadd/FridayTask2.git  

Q2: Create your branch with your name (eg:-“AdityaTask2”)  

Q3: Write a code for each of the questions given below and save them with your initials and question no. (eg:-ABQuestionA). Once all questions are completed push the code on GitHub and merge with the “main” branch.  

A) The objective is to return all pairs of integers from a given array of integers that has a difference of 2.  
Example:  
[1, 2, 3, 4]  should return [[1, 3], [2, 4]]  
[4, 1, 2, 3]  should also return [[1, 3], [2, 4]]  
[1, 23, 3, 4, 7] should return [[1, 3]]  
4, 3, 1, 5, 6] should return [[1, 3], [3, 5], [4, 6]]  

B) Number of people inside the bus  
There is a bus moving in the city, and it picks and drops some people at each bus stop.  
You are provided with a list (or array) of integer arrays. Each integer array has two items which represents number of people getting on the bus as the first item and number of people get off the bus as the second item.  

Your task is to return the number of people who are still in the bus even after reaching the last bus stop (after the last array). Even though it is the last bus stop, the bus is not empty and some people are still in the bus, and they are probably sleeping there :D
Take a look at the test cases.
{[10,0],[4,3],[2,8]}
(1) Ensure that the number of people in the bus is always >= 0. So the return integer can't be negative.  
(2) The second item in the first integer array is 0, since the bus is empty in the first bus stop so nobody is there to get off the bus.  

C) You are going to be given a word. Your job is to return the middle character of the word. If the word's length is odd, return the middle character. If the word's length is even, return the 2 characters that appear in the middle.    
Example:  
"test" should return "es"  
"testing" should return "t"  

D) In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other, as "C" and "G". You are provided with one side of the DNA you need to get the other complementary side. DNA strands are never empty or there is no DNA at all  
Examples:  
"ATTGC" should return "TAACG"  
"GTAT"  should return "CATA"   

Q4: Create a new repository with the name “FridayTask” in your own Github Account.   

Q5: Update readme.md file with all the questions of Friday tasks given below.  

Q6: Create a new branch and write the codes for problems given below under that branch:  

1. Write a code to get the consecutive sub-array from the given array such that it gives the maximum value eg:
Input array:- [-1,2,4,2,5,-7,3]  
Expected Output:-  
Sub array: [2,4,2,5] (where max value=2+4+2+5=13)  

2. Write a code to merge the two arrays of different length.  
Example:  
([1,3,5,7,9],[2,4,6,8]) should return [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]  

Q7: Push all codes from that branch and merge it with the main branch.
